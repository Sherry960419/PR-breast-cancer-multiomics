# PR Project – Breast Cancer Radiogenomic Analysis

This repository contains the project for the **Pattern Recognition (PR)** course.

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether multi-omic molecular features (gene expression and copy-number alteration) can be used to predict breast cancer tumor shape and support interpretable, AI-assisted case-level reporting.

## Dataset
- TCGA-BRCA cohort
- Gene expression and copy-number alteration (CNA) data
- Radiologist-annotated tumor shape labels

## Methods
- Variance-based feature selection
- Logistic Regression, Lasso, Random Forest
- Patient-centric molecular deviation analysis
- LLM-assisted structured report generation

## Course Information
- Course: Pattern Recognition
- Term: Fall 2025
- Student: Shenyu Yu
